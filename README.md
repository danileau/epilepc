Webapplication for maintaining epileptic seizures incl. diary function 

Within the scope of my diploma thesis I will realize this application. The application will not be implemented until April during the HERMES Realization phase.
Expected functions:
- Seizure - Seizures can be documented and processed with an exact time specification.
- Diary - One diary can be kept per user. Links to the seizures are possible, but not yet defined.
- Events - Serious events can be documented here with time information.
- Drugs - Here you can maintain the medication taken and its dosage.
- Overview - The data maintained above can be visualized here in the overview compiled to discover correlations. Also PDF export is planned 
Filter: Datepicker and time span
- Authentication
